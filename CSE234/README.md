# CSE234 - Logic Circuits And Design Laboratory

This repository contains the projects and lab assignments for the CSE234 - Logic Circuits And Design Laboratory course. The course provides hands-on experience with digital logic design, from basic gates to more complex sequential and combinational circuits, using Verilog and FPGAs.

## Course Description

The "Logic Circuits And Design Laboratory" (CSE 234) is a compulsory, first-cycle undergraduate course offered in the spring semester. It carries 2 ECTS credits and aims to provide hands-on experience with logic circuit concepts. The course covers topics such as digital logic gates, Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuits, and memory units. Assessment includes laboratory exercises and a final exam.
