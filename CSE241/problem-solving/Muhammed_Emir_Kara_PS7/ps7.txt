Instructions
## Q1
Write a template-based class that implements a set of items.  The class should allow the user to:

a.    Add a new item to the set
b.    Get the number of items in the set
c.    Get a pointer to a dynamically created array containing each item in the set.  The caller of this function is responsible for de-allocating the memory.

      Test your class by creating sets of different data types (e.g. integers, strings, etc.)
## Q2

Write a Pair class (similar to Display 16.4) so that the pair of items can be different data types.  Write a main function that tests the class with pairs of different data types.
