# CSE108 - Computer Programming Laboratory

This repository contains the projects and lab assignments for the CSE108 - Computer Programming Laboratory course. This course provides practical support for the CSE102 Programming in C course, focusing on reading, understanding, and writing C programs, converting algorithms to C code, and working in teams.

## Course Description

The "Computer Programming Laboratory" (CSE 108) is a compulsory, first-cycle undergraduate course offered in the spring semester. It provides hands-on experience to support the theoretical concepts learned in the CSE102 Programming in C course. The curriculum focuses on developing practical skills in C programming, including basic IO, expressions, conditional logic, loops, functions, file operations, arrays, structs, dynamic memory allocation, and fundamental data structures like linked lists and binary search trees. Assessment is based entirely on laboratory exercises.
