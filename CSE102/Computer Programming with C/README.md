# CSE102 - Assignment 0: Introduction to C Programming

## Description

This project is an introduction to the C programming language and the Linux development environment. The primary goal of this assignment is to build a foundation for future projects by learning the essential tools and practices for C development. This includes working with `makefiles`, compiling C source code with `GCC` on an `Ubuntu` system, and implementing a simple interactive game.

## Objectives

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with the following concepts:

*   **Basic C Syntax:** Understanding variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
*   **Compiling with GCC:** Learning how to use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to compile C code.
*   **Makefiles:** Writing and using a `makefile` to automate the build process.
*   **Development Environment:** Gaining experience with a standard C development environment on Ubuntu.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Applying programming logic to solve a simple problem.

## Getting Started

To compile and run this project, you will need to have `GCC` and `make` installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emirgit/GTU-UNIVERSITYASSIGNMENTS.git
