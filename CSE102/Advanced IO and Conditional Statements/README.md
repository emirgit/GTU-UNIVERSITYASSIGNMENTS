## Features

This program is divided into four main parts, each demonstrating a different C programming concept:

1.  **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator:**
    *   Calculates the GCD of two integers using the **Euclidean Algorithm**.
    *   Demonstrates the use of loops and basic arithmetic operations.

2.  **Formatted Integer Summation:**
    *   Takes two integers as input and prints their sum.
    *   Showcases advanced `printf` formatting to ensure the numbers and the result are right-aligned, regardless of the number of digits.

3.  **Manual Multiplication Process:**
    *   Displays the step-by-step process of multiplying two integers, simulating how it's done by hand.
    *   Highlights integer manipulation and formatted output control.

4.  **Conditional Number Check:**
    *   Checks if a given integer is within the range and also greater than 5.
    *   A practical example of using `if-else` conditional statements to handle different logical cases.

## Learning Objectives

*   **Advanced `printf` Usage:** Mastering format specifiers for alignment and padding.
*   **Algorithmic Thinking:** Implementing a classic mathematical algorithm (Euclidean).
*   **Conditional Logic:** Using `if-else` statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.
*   **Function Implementation:** Structuring code into logical, reusable functions.
*   **Modular Programming:** Separating different tasks into distinct parts within a single program.
